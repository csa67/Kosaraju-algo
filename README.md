# Kosaraju's Algorithm Implementations

Kosaraju's algorithm is an efficient method for finding strongly connected components (SCCs) in a directed graph. It uses depth-first search (DFS) twiceâ€”once to determine the finishing order of vertices and once to explore the transposed graph.

### Implementations:
- [C++ Implementation](Kosaraju.cpp)
- [Python Implementation](Kosaraju.py)
- [Java Implementation](KosarajuSCC.java)
